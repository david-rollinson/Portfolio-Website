          <span style="font-weight: 400">David Rollinson</span> is a creative
          technologist who vitalises spaces and materials with interactive
          technologies. At the centre of their work in experiential environment
          design and development are computational systems used to investigate
          phenomenology and social valuation. Their creative skills readily to
          hand include experience design, 2D/3D graphical programming, CGI
          design and animation, custom electronics and creative ML. Last year
          they combined these into a hypermedia installation exhibited at
          Bargehouse Gallery, Southbank.
