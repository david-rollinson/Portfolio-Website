Personal projects in Blender. These are fully rendered video/image works as opposed to generative or interactive tools. There are more in the making. 

**Facade modelling (WIP), geometry nodes project:**

Facade in Renaissance style as reference - a street in Poznan, Poland. 

Facade modelling, using an image of Poznan town houses as reference. I used geometry nodes to create the roof tiles, and have parented each object in preparation for rendering procedural buildings using geometry nodes. 

**Furniture modelling:**
