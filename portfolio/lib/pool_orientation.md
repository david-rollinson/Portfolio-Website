# Pool (Orientation 1).

Tags: 2D, 3D, Artwork, C++, GLSL, ML, Python, Skanect Pro, XD

Multimedia Installation for ‘EPHEMERENCE’ digital arts show at Oxo Tower Wharf, SE1 9PH, exhibited May 2022. 

**Solo graduate project, titled ‘Pool (Orientation 1)’**

Materials: 3D Printed PLA Light Shades, Dual Monitors, Xbox Kinect, MDF Buttress in Blue. 

Technologies: OpenFrameworks, OpenGL, NVIDIA StyleGAN2-ADA (Pytorch), Skanect Pro, Arduino, Fusion360.

**Loose motivation outline:**

I was inspired by Sara Ahmed's 'Queer Phenomenology' to work with form and image in a way that disrupted their apparent physical orientation, as a homage to the disrupted spatial social/political relations queerness offers, touched upon in her book. Derived from this, the light shades and GAN film each offer an interpretation of the ‘hollow-face illusion’. The archway is painted cobalt blue in homage to Derek Jarman, who proposes similar aesthetic philosophies to Ahmed in his 1991 film ‘Blue’.
