Vitrolithic Ferrous Homunculi is a stereoscopic film by David Rollinson and Nate Townsend, shot with custom 3D printed stereoscopic camera rig and translated using Stable and Warp Diffusion. Scored by [Anna Latham](https://soundcloud.com/anna-latham-1).  
The film was originally conceived to be displayed inside the residency space at The Beams. As such, there are two versions of the film - a rendering inside 'Delta Functions' and another screen-only version. See both below.

Inspired by the novel, '*Neuromancer*' by William Gibson and the japanese video game, '*[Densha De Go!](https://youtu.be/R9LlMSMsgrc?t=105)*' by Taito.   
Exhibited as part of 'Delta Functions' at Thin Air, The Beams in June 2023.
