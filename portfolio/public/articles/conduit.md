This project serves as an applied instance of a wider investigation into interaction styles with material states and behaviour. After reading the premise of vital materialism set out by Jane Bennett in her book 'Vibrant Matter', I became interested in artistic spaces that foster hyper-sensitivity to materials as a way to align an audience with earth-centred principles.

Kinetic sculpture solo project for digital arts exhibition, 'Third___' May 2021. Conceived as interactive, but reconfigured due to COVID-19 restrictions.   

Materials: Black plastic truncated cylinder vessel, aquarium tubing, hydroxyethyl cellulose in Black, three 12V vacuum pumps.
Technologies: Arduino using custom electronics. JUCE delay plugin for Ableton Live (not shown).

A black plastic vessel holds an oily substance. Aquarium tubes are arranged running from three vacuum pumps into the base of the vessel. A system of arduino electonics senses the weight of the material in each of the three glasses and modulates the air output of each pump accordingly, causing bubbles rise to the surface.

Closeup of vacuum pumps and electronics. The Arduino board receives the weight values of the three glasses and modulates power to each corresponding vacuum pump motor (using two motor driver shields).

An air intake valve is located at the top of each pump. From here the motor pushes air through the release valve, funnelling air through the aquarium tubing and into the base of the vessel. The less force, the lower the air output.
