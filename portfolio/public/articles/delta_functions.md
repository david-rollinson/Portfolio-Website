<b>‘Delta Functions’</b> was a dynamic creative technology residency held at Thin Air, The Beams. Over 3 months, artists used the gallery as their studio to continuously develop new interactive digital filters for audience play. Exhibition visitors were invited to participate by interacting with camera and voice-activated graphics, seeing real-time responses on-screen. The residency’s aim was to reveal the process of digital art-making as residents honed their skills throughout the exhibition. As a consolidation of this, residents devised, coordinated and launched a public showcase to present during the exhibition's final two weeks, which included performance, playable-experience and film.
