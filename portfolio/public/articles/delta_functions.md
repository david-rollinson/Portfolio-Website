Delta Functions was a 3 month incubator for creative technology development at The Beams, Centre for New Culture. The initiative's goal was to produce interactive digital prototypes for a public audience as a demonstration of computational arts practice. In consolidation of this, residents devised, coordinated and launched a public showcase, which included networked performance, playable-experience and film.

The results of this were often highly experimental, with the residency space used as a laboratory to test networked interactions with a variety of interfaces,  including cameras, microphones, IR sensors, capacitive touch sensors and motion tracking.
