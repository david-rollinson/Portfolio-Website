Multimedia Installation for ‘EPHEMERENCE’ digital arts show at Oxo Tower Wharf, SE1 9PH, exhibited May 2022.   

Materials: 3D Printed PLA Light Shades, Dual Monitors, Xbox Kinect, MDF Buttress in Blue.  
Technologies: OpenFrameworks, OpenGL, NVIDIA StyleGAN2-ADA (Pytorch), Skanect Pro, Arduino, Fusion360.

I was inspired by Sara Ahmed's 'Queer Phenomenology' to work with form and image in a way that disrupted their apparent physical orientation, as a homage to the disrupted spatial social/political relations queerness offers, touched upon in her book. Derived from this, the light shades and GAN film each offer an interpretation of the ‘hollow-face illusion’. The archway is painted cobalt blue in homage to Derek Jarman, who proposes similar aesthetic philosophies to Ahmed in his 1991 film ‘Blue’.

The light shades were modelled using Xbox Kinect, Skanect Pro and Fusion 360. 3D scanned faces were used to deform the spherical geometry.
An Arduino controls and powers the sweep lighting effect across a 5V neopixel LED array.

Audience-interactive graphics feed, exhibited on the uppermost screen of the buttress. 

Kinect sensor surveys the spatial and chromatic parameters of the gallery space using LIDAR and camera, relaying live metrics to Open Frameworks sketch which modulates the screen graphics.
